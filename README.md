# ApartmentFinder-Public

This is a final project for a graduate level introduction to data science course, completed by four team members. We created a recommender system for apartment searches in the greater Providence area, based on user input and preferences. Considerations include budget, safety/"walkability", distance from Brown University, number of bedrooms among other elements.
